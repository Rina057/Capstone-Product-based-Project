# Capstone Product-based Project
## WasteWise

### About this project
WasteWise is an innovative waste sorting and management application, aimed to foster a more environmentally responsible society and encourage greater recycling efforts. This project focuses on automating waste sorting through machine learning techniques, providing recycling tutorials, and connecting community members and craftsmen. The key deliverables include a functional waste sorting algorithm, a user-friendly application interface, and an integrated platform connecting waste sellers and buyers.

### Mobile Development Part
Developing a mobile application involves creating user flow and design by utilizing Figma. Next is converting the design into a Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototype. Then it is  implemented using Android Studio, and data can be fetched from rest APIs. Finally, the app is integrated into cloud-based systems.

### Machine Learning Part
Developing a machine learning model for the project. This involves searching and collecting the dataset by using websites such as Kaggle, followed by creating, training and debugging the ML model using Google Colaboratory, and lastly integrating the ML model and deployment using TensorFlow lite. 

### Cloud Computing Part
We will create a database and API for Android to communicate with the Server and Machine Learning to access the data via the API to use in building the model. If the API used is compromised, we will prepare an alternative API to minimize the problem.
